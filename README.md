# Hotel-Management
Java and Oracle Database Project

A hotel consists of many employees, many rooms and guests. In the database system, employees can be identified by their name, address, phone number, id, job title, salary, hire date. The employee also can have promotion or salary increase percentage. On the other hand, rooms can be identified by their number, rent, if they are hired or not, again if they are reserved or not. Again, the guests’ information will be stored with their name, phone number, room number, payment, advanced payment, check in and check out date, payment method, bill. If a guest reserves a room, there will be also a table for keeping this information. When a room is checked in by a guest, then an employee is assigned to that room. This information will be added to that employee’s table. On the other hand, if a guest requests a meal, food, beverage or any other thing, cost of these things will be added to their bill at the time of their checkout. There will be a graphical interface for the users where they can look for the hotel room, rent and they can also reserve a room. The user can also add, delete, edit the reservation. The users can see the employees’ name, job title but they are not able to see the whole employees’ table.
